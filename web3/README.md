# GearFi 2.0 web3 portion

phase 1

  - The listing part will be done by ourself from a different platform
    - There we will mint the nft in our own name and will list the nft in this platform.

  - here we will have some NFTs already listed in our platform and any user could come and purchase the NFTs. 
  - when the user buys the NFT, he would have to pay only 10% of the actual amount in which the NFT is listed. 
  - user can further pay rest of the amount either in parts or in one go.
  - when the user will pay the loan completely, we will display the nft status as repaid and the nft will now solely be of that user.
  - In between, owner can put the NFT in margin trading. This NFT would be shown in all the total listings.
  - here we want to make a platform in which a user can come
